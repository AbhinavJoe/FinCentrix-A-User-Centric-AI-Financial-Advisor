Definition: Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest.
Explanation: Compound interest is calculated by multiplying the initial principal amount by one plus the annual interest rate raised to the number of compound periods minus one. For example, if $1,000 is invested at an annual interest rate of 4% compounded annually for 3 years, the future value of the investment would be $1,000 * (1 + 0.04)^3 = $1,124.86.
